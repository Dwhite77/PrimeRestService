# üß† Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a foundational algorithm for generating all prime numbers up to a given limit. It‚Äôs simple, efficient, and forms the basis for more advanced techniques like segmented and parallel sieving.

## üìò Core Algorithm

### How It Works

1. Create a boolean array `isPrime[0..n]` and initialize all entries to `true`.
2. Starting from `p = 2`, mark all multiples of `p` as `false`.
3. Move to the next `p` that is still marked `true` and repeat.
4. Stop when `p * p > n`.

This process leaves only the prime numbers marked as `true`.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

For each prime `p`, the sieve marks all multiples of `p` up to `n`.  
The total number of operations across all primes ‚â§ `n` is roughly:

    Total work ‚âà n √ó (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + ...)

This sum behaves like `log(log(n))`, giving the algorithm its well-known time complexity:

**O(n log log n)**

## üß© Segmented Sieve

To scale the sieve for large values of `n`, I use a segmented approach. This breaks the problem into manageable chunks and avoids allocating memory for the entire range.

### Phase 1: Base Prime Generation

- Compute all primes ‚â§ ‚àön using the classic sieve.
- These primes are used to eliminate composites in higher segments.

### Phase 2: Chunked Sieving

- Divide the range `[‚àön + 1, n]` into chunks.
- For each chunk:
    - Initialize all values as prime.
    - For each base prime `p`:
        - Find the first multiple of `p` within the chunk.
        - Mark all multiples of `p` as composite.

This keeps memory usage localized and avoids redundant computation.

## üßµ Multi-threaded Execution

When `threads > 1`, the algorithm distributes chunks across multiple threads. Each thread processes its segment independently using the shared base primes.

### Parallel Speedup

With `t` threads, the ideal time complexity becomes:

    O(n log log n / t)

### Thread Behavior

- A thread pool manages concurrent execution.
- Each thread marks composites in its assigned chunk.
- Base primes are shared read-only‚Äîno locking required.
- Once all threads complete, results are merged and sorted.

This design is cache-friendly, thread-safe, and scales cleanly across cores.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Efficient for large upper limits (e.g. 10‚Å∑+)
- Thread-safe and cache-aware
- Modular structure supports future optimizations

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Memory usage grows with segment size
- Not suitable for testing primality of individual large numbers

---

## üß† Execution Modes

- **Single-threaded Mode**  
  Processes chunks sequentially.  
  Best for small to medium ranges.  
  Performance: *Fast*

- **Multi-threaded Mode**  
  Splits chunks across threads for parallel processing.  
  Shared base primes, no locking.  
  Performance: *Faster*

This implementation is deterministic, scalable, and well-suited for benchmarking prime generation across input sizes and thread counts.
