# 🧠 Prime Algorithms Documentation

Welcome to the Prime API project! This repository benchmarks and documents various prime number generation algorithms, including trial division, sieves, and probabilistic methods. Below you'll find direct links to all documentation files.

## 📄 Documentation Index

- [Prime Algorithms Overview](src/main/resources/docs/prime-algorithms.md)
- [Trial Division](src/main/resources/docs/trial.md)
- [Sieve of Eratosthenes](src/main/resources/docs/sieve.md)
- [Sieve of Atkin](src/main/resources/docs/atkin.md)
- [Miller-Rabin Test](src/main/resources/docs/miller.md)
- [Error Handling](src/main/resources/docs/error-handling.md)
- [Project README](src/main/resources/docs/README.md)

## 🚀 API Highlights

The Prime API supports multiple algorithms and thread configurations. You can:
- Generate primes up to 1,000,000
- Choose between trial, sieve, and segmented sieve
- Benchmark performance across thread counts

See [`prime-algorithms.md`](src/main/resources/docs/prime-algorithms.md) for detailed comparisons.

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

- All endpoints are documented and tested
- Markdown rendering is optimized for contributor clarity
- Error responses are standardized via `ErrorPayload`
