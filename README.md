# ðŸ§® PrimeAPI

### ðŸ”— [Main Render Deployment Page](https://primerestservice.onrender.com/) : https://primerestservice.onrender.com/
### ðŸ”— [Swagger Link](https://primerestservice.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html)
PrimeAPI is a modular, high-performance Java application for generating prime numbers using multiple algorithms. It exposes a RESTful API, supports parallel execution, and includes a built-in documentation viewer powered by Markdown and HTML rendering.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Multiple prime generation algorithms: Trial Division, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Sieve of Atkin, Millerâ€“Rabin
- Parallel execution with thread pooling
- REST API with JSON and XML support
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Markdown-based documentation portal with sidebar navigation
- Structured error handling and fallback responses
- Benchmarking and performance logging
- Full test coverage with JaCoCo (92%)

## ðŸ§  Algorithms

Each algorithm implements the `PrimeAlgorithm` interface and is registered via Springâ€™s dependency injection. Parallelization is handled by `AbstractPrimeAlgorithm` using `ThreadPoolManager`.

| Algorithm              | Time Complexity        | Use Case Notes                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Trial Division         | O(âˆšn)                  | Simple, slow; good for small inputs or teaching     |
| Sieve of Eratosthenes  | O(n log log n)         | Fast for generating all primes up to n              |
| Sieve of Atkin         | O(n) (theoretical)     | Complex; faster than Eratosthenes for large n       |
| Millerâ€“Rabin           | O(k logÂ³ n)            | Probabilistic; efficient for testing one number     |

## ðŸ“¦ API Endpoints

### `/api/primes`
- https://primerestservice.onrender.com/api/primes?limit=1000&algorithm=sieve&threads=2
- Generates prime numbers using the specified algorithm.

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit` (int): Upper bound for prime generation (This is Currently limited to 1000000000)
- `algorithm` (string): One of `trial`, `sieve`, `atkin`, `miller`
- `threads` (int): Number of threads to use (This is Currently limited to 128)

**Response:**  
Returns a `PrimePayload` with algorithm name, limit, thread count, prime list, total count, and duration.

### `/api/info`
- https://primerestservice.onrender.com/api/info
- Returns the landing page HTML with links to documentation.

### `/docs`
- https://primerestservice.onrender.com/docs
- Lists available Markdown documentation files.

### `/docs/view/{filename}`
- https://primerestservice.onrender.com/docs/view/Atkin.md
- Renders a Markdown file as styled HTML with sidebar and backlinks.

### Error Simulation Endpoints
Used for testing global exception handling:
- `/api/trigger-runtime-exception`
- `/api/trigger-response-status`
- `/api/trigger-illegal-argument`

## ðŸ§° Error Handling

All exceptions are handled by `GlobalExceptionHandler`, which maps common Spring and runtime errors to structured `APIResponse` objects.

**Handled Cases:**
- Missing parameters
- Type mismatches
- Unsupported HTTP methods
- Malformed request bodies
- Unknown paths
- Runtime exceptions

**Response Structure:**
- `status` â€“ HTTP code
- `error` â€“ Label (e.g. Bad Request)
- `message` â€“ Explanation
- `path` â€“ Triggering endpoint
- `timestamp` â€“ Formatted as `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss`

Reusable payloads are constructed via `ErrorResponseBuilder`.

---

## ðŸ“š Documentation Portal


Markdown files are stored in `resources/docs` and rendered via `HtmlHelper` and `MarkdownConverter`.

**Features:**
- Sidebar navigation
- Grouped sections: Algorithms, Informational, Miscellaneous
- Backlinks for intuitive navigation
- Embedded algorithm comparison and recent request tables
- Caching via `CacheConfig` for performance

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

Testing is divided into:

- **Unit Tests**: Validate algorithm logic, model serialization, and utility behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Verify controller behavior, error handling, and service logic
- **Benchmarking**: Measure performance across algorithms and thread counts

Coverage is tracked via **JaCoCo**, including:
- Instruction coverage (lines executed)
- Branch coverage (decision paths tested)
- Cyclomatic complexity (number of independent logic paths)
- Method/class visibility (which components are exercised)

## ðŸ‘¥ Contributor Guide

- Add new algorithms by implementing `PrimeAlgorithm` and extending `AbstractPrimeAlgorithm`
- Register via `@Component` for auto-discovery
- Document new algorithms in `docs/` and link them in `buildIndexContent(...)`
- Use `PrimeAlgorithmTestSupport` for consistent test coverage
- Validate both JSON and XML serialization
- Ensure all endpoints are covered by integration tests
